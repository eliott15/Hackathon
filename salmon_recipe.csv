Place the salmon fillets into a single layer on the trivet and sprinkle them generously with salt and pepper. Secure the lid and turn the pressure release valve to sealing. Use the manual setting to cook on high pressure for 3 minutes. (If using frozen fish fillets, cook them on high pressure for 5 minutes instead. No need to thaw.)When the cooking cycle has completed, quickly turn the pressure release valve to venting to release the pressure. Serve the fish warm with your favorite sauce and side dish.

1,1016387,Crispy Skin Salmon,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1016387-312x231.jpg,0,[],[],0.0,"Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle the skin side with a pinch or two of salt (no pepper at this point), and allow to rest for 5 minutes. The salt will draw more moisture out of the skin. (This translates to crispier skin!) Pat the skin completely dry again.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium to medium-high (about 6 or 7 on a scale of 10). An uncoated pan or cast iron skillet will allow for a better sear than a nonstick skillet. Test the heat level by letting a drop of water fall onto the skillet. It should sizzle. (This will take approximately 3 minutes for a gas stove, 5 minutes for electric.)
Place the salmon skin side down in the pan. Do not move the fillets. Sprinkle the top of the fillets with a little salt and pepper, and allow the salmon to cook for 5 minutes or until the skin is well browned and the fillets are cooked about three quarters of the way through. Using a sturdy metal spatula, turn the fillets and cook until the fish is done to your liking. This could be a quick 15-30 seconds if you prefer your salmon pink in the center or another minute or so if you like your fish cooked through. (See Notes**)
For maximum crispness, serve immediately with the skin side up.",3.7862,False,False,True,True

Bake until the internal temperature of the salmon reaches 140F*, about 4-6 minutes per half inch of thickness (measured by the thickest part of the filet).  You can also test for doneness by inserting a fork or knife in the salmon and twisting it a bit; the fish should be opaque and flake easily.

Prepare the grill for direct cooking over high heat, 450F-550F. Brush the cooking grates clean and close the lid to heat.

Generously coat the flesh side of the salmon fillets with oil and season evenly with kosher salt and black pepper. Grill the salmon skin side down over direct high heat with the lid closed, for about 6-8 minutes or until the fish lightens in color, becomes more firm to the touch and you can lift the fillets off the cooking grates without them sticking. 

Turn the salmon over, close the lid, and cook to 130F or about 2-4 minutes for medium rare or longer to desired doneness. Transfer to a platter to rest for 1-2 minutes.

Cover the container and marinate for at least 30 minutes, and up to overnight.

Broil the salmon: Line a broiling pan with aluminum foil. Brush a little vegetable oil over the foil and lay the salmon fillets on top. Make sure there is an even, thin coating of marinade on top of the fish.
Place the fillets no closer than about 6 inches from the broiler element in your oven. Broil for 6-10 minutes, depending on how thick the fillets are and how hot your broiler is.
 
Keep an eye on the salmon. The marinade has sugar in it that can easily cause the glaze to burn. If it starts charring and the cooking isn't yet finished, place the fish on a lower rack in the oven.
