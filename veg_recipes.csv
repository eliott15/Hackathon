0,1029223,Zucchini Noodles Made Easy,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1029223-312x231.jpg,0,[],[],0.0,"Using a vegetable peeler, press firmly into the zucchini and peel it into long, wide ribbons. Work your way around the zucchini (sort of like its a rectangle and youre peeling the four sides), stopping when you get to the seeds.  Discard the seedy core.
Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  When hot, add the zucchini ribbons and sprinkle with salt (I use about 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt) and several grinds of the pepper mill. Cook, tossing and stirring the zucchini, for 2 to 3 minutes only (I err on the shorter side).  The ribbons should be just softened and not limp or mushy.  Adjust the seasonings to taste, and transfer to a serving dish.
Serve as is or toss with pesto or marinara sauce, or stir in add-ins of choice.  Delicious served hot or at room temperature.



Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment for easy cleanup.
In a mixing bowl, clean produce or zip-top bag, or with your hands directly on the baking sheet, toss the tomatoes and mushrooms with the oil. You can eyeball this, as you want just enough oil to lightly coat the veggies.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and then spread in an even layer on the baking sheet.  Bake for 15 minutes, give them a stir, and then spread them back out and roast for 5-10 minutes more or until tender and lightly caramelized.
Enjoy hot or at room temperature. Delicious stirred into traditional pasta or zucchini noodles, spooned over fish or chicken, added to orzo and quinoa salads, etc.",73.41,True,True,True,True
